              I know I missed a really important moment, and I've been kicking myself for it because it wasn't just any moment. It was your moment. The one you've worked so hard for, dreamed about, and absolutely earned.

I want to take a second to say just how proud I am of you.

I remember all the times you'd say, 'One day, I just want to work at a big company.' It wasn't just talk. You were putting in the work. Late nights, constant studying, pushing yourself even when you were nervous or unsure. You didn't just wish for it you built the road to get there.

And then, when the offer finally came and you were standing in a changing room in Marshalls, of all places life just decided that was the perfect way to surprise you. That moment, even though I missed it live, is now etched in my heart. I can only imagine the shock, the disbelief, the joy. And honestly, knowing how much this means to you. I couldn't be happier for you.

Bebo, you've never needed validation from any job or title, but this? This is huge. Amazon, software development, New York this is a leap, and you're taking it.

What amazes me most isn't just that you got the offer. It's how you're stepping way out of your comfort zone. I know you you love the calm of the suburbs, the quiet, the peace. And yet, here you are ready to move to a giant, loud, unpredictable city, just to chase something bigger. That takes guts. That takes vision. That takes you.

In the four years we've been together, I've seen you grow into someone even stronger, more driven, and more inspiring. You light up when you talk about your dreams, and now you're turning those dreams into reality.

So today, I just want to say  I'm proud of you, I admire you, and I love you.

This chapter you're starting? It's just the beginning. And I'll be here, cheering you on, every step of the way.

                I promise to always be there to support you, celebrate your victories, and help you
